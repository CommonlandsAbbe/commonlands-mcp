# Commonlands MCP Architecture

## Current scope

The Worker is being built in PR-sized phases:

- Phase 0 proved deployment and MCP connectivity with `GET /healthz` and initialize-only `POST /mcp`.
- Phase 1 adds fixture-backed read-only catalog tools/resources while real DynamoDB and Shopify credentials/schema are still unconfirmed.
- Later phases replace fixtures with a scheduled joined catalog snapshot and add optics/recommendation/product-detail capabilities behind tests.

No live Shopify, Acumatica, or database behavior is implemented yet. No checkout, cart, inventory mutation, or write tool is implemented.

## Target endpoint

Production target: `https://mcp.commonlands.com/mcp`.

Cloudflare account, route, zone, and deployment environment are placeholders until confirmed by Max/Abbe.

## Source-of-truth model for later phases

- DynamoDB/AppSync lens data remains the optical source of truth.
- Shopify is enrichment/commerce only: handles, URLs, variants, price, availability, and public mechanical drawing links.
- Datasheets stay gated through product-page/DocSend flow; the MCP must not emit direct DocSend URLs.
- Acumatica is not part of the MCP write path. No direct Acumatica writes are permitted.
- All future tools must stay read-only until an explicit approval and auth model exists.

## Safety boundaries

- No Shopify writes.
- No Acumatica writes.
- No database writes.
- No secrets in source control.
- No direct DocSend URLs in fixtures, responses, logs, or docs.
- No checkout/cart/write tools in the public MVP.

## Deployment metadata

The Worker reads these non-secret vars:

- `ENVIRONMENT`
- `VERSION`
- `GIT_SHA`

Secrets needed by later phases are documented in `docs/secrets.md` and must be configured through Cloudflare/environment secret storage, not committed.

## Phase 1 MCP surface

Phase 1 exposes these read-only methods from fixture-backed catalog data:

- `tools/list`
- `tools/call` for `search_lenses`, `get_lens_details`, and `get_sensor_specs`
- `resources/list`
- `resources/read` for `commonlands://catalog/lenses` and `commonlands://catalog/sensors`

Responses include MCP-style `structuredContent` plus text content for tool calls. Lens responses intentionally return gated datasheet notes instead of direct DocSend URLs. Mechanical drawing URLs are limited to validated HTTPS Commonlands or Shopify CDN hosts.
